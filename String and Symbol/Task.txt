Question: Which should we prefer String and Symbol ? And why?
Answer:  
  String	
	=> Strings is anything that is written between quotation marks, either “” or ‘’;
	=> Everytime you create a string in ruby, it occupies new memory space.
		e.g.
		“Information”.object_id
		“Information”.object_id
		output of above both will be different, even though content is same
	=> String objects are mutable which means there values could be changed later on.

  Symbol:
	
	=>A symbol is text that begins with a colon.
		e.g. 
		:hello
		:data
	=> Symbols are immutable!
	=> The immutable nature of symbols makes them very valuable in programming
	=> String objects are mutable which means there values could be changed later on
	=> Since symbols are immutable, they always refer to the same object and the same place 		   in memory

  Which is better to use:
	
	Strings can reduce a program’s performance if string objects are repeatedly created and 	  	destroyed when the same object could have been reused in their place. For this reason, a 		program that uses symbols over strings (when possible) will run more efficiently and 	smoothly.
