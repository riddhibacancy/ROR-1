1)  Why readines was not printing \n?

    • compiler treat \n as a new line creator so when we try to print it compiler replace with new line if we want to print \n then we need to write "\\n" .

2)  why "ruby file_copy.rb < sometext.txt > everything.txt" command first started writing from sometext.txt into file_copy.rb and not directly writing to everything.txt

    • file_copy.rb first take a sometext.txt as a input and then output of the file_copy.rb overwrite into everything.txt
